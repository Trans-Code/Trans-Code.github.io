**Why:**

Co-founder Naomi Ceder explains: “As technology offers growing opportunities, being sure these opportunities are equally accessible to traditionally marginalized groups grows ever more important.

“Trans*Code participants can come from any background, working together to create prototypes around the themes of transgender issues and access to technology.

“If you have an idea, can code, can design, want to learn, or want to improve the situation of the trans and non-binary communities through technology, please join us.”
