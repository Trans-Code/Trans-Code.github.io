# Trans\*Code at [EuroPython](https://ep2023.europython.eu/)!

## Trans\*Code returns to EuroPython
At EuroPython 2022 in Dublin last summer Trans\*Code held its joyous return after the pandemic. This year, in collaboration with the trans/NB community in Czechia we will be back to continue building the tradition. The event at EuroPython in **Prague** will take place on **Tuesday, 18 July, 2023.**

EuroPython has financial aid available, so this is a great chance to take part in a Trans\*Code event, attend Europython, **and** visit Prague July 18! If you're interested in taking part please feel free to get in touch at trans_code@europython.eu or you can ping Naomi with any questions at info@trans.tech.

And please spread the word throughout your trans/NB communities far and wide!

## What is Trans\*Code?

Trans*Code is where you can connect and share ideas with trans and non-binary folks as well as allies and co-conspirators. Where trans/NB people are not just included but centered. Where you can explore that pet idea for a tech project centered around your experiences. Where you can make new contacts and forge new friendships. Where you can breathe. 

Trans\*Code events are similar to hackathons, but with some key differences:
* Events are only one day long. If you can’t get free for an entire weekend, 
* Events are not competitive. At Trans\*Code events, we’re all pulling for each other. While we do have final presentations, they are made in the spirit of sharing, not in the spirit of competition.
* Events encourage following your interests. Want to work on that project? Fine, do it. Want to spend the morning with this one, and the afternoon with that one? The choice is yours. Trans\*Code subscribes to the Un-Conference philosophy - whatever happens is exactly what should happen.

Trans\*Code is an international hack event series focused solely on building connections and community while exploring the tech side of transgender issues and opportunities. Trans\*Code events are informal hackdays where participants can explore their ideas in collaboration with likeminded people. Coders, designers, activists, visionaries of all sorts, and community members not currently working in technology are all welcome and encouraged to participate.

### What happens at Trans\*Code?
The day kicks off with the people who have projects briefly describing their ideas of what they want to work on. Everyone then has the chance to join the project that they find interesting, and the day’s brainstorming/planning/coding/etc begins. This continues into the afternoon with breaks for lunch and snacks, until at the end of the afternoon, someone from each project gives an update to the group as a whole. Once the day is done, it’s common for people to go off to find dinner and to continue the conversation. 


## Why Trans\*Code
Co-organiser Naomi Ceder explains: “As technology offers growing opportunities, being sure these opportunities are equally accessible to traditionally marginalised groups grows ever more important.

“Trans\*Code participants can come from any background, working together to create prototypes around the themes of transgender issues and access to technology.

“If you have an idea, can code, can design, want to learn, or want to improve the situation of the trans and non-binary communities through technology, please join us.”
