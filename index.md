# Trans*Code at Europython!

## Trans*Code returns

After nearly 3 years of virus hiatus, Trans\*Code will be returning! We are delighted that [Europython](https://ep2022.europython.eu/) will be hosting a Trans\*Code event in Dublin in July! (note snazzy logo at top of page ;-) )

We would love to have more help in planning and running this event as well as people to attend. Europython has financial aid available, so this is a great chance to take part in a Trans\*Code event, attend Europython, **and** visit Dublin in July! If you're interested in taking part please feel free to get in touch at trans_code@europython.eu or you can ping Naomi with any questions at info@trans.tech.

And please spread the word throughout your trans/NB communities far and wide!

# Trans*Code Hackday and workshops

## What is Trans*Code?

Trans*Code is an international  hack event series focused solely on drawing attention to transgender issues and opportunities.

Open to trans and non-binary folk, allies, coders, designers and visionaries of all sorts, Trans*Code was inspired by the groundbreaking [Trans`*`H4CK](http://www.transhack.org/)  events created by Dr. Kortney Ziegler. 

Trans*Code events aim to help draw attention to transgender issues through informal, topic-focused hackdays. Coders, designers, activitists, and community members not currently working in technology are also encouraged to participate

## Why Trans*Code
Co-organiser Naomi Ceder explains: “As technology offers growing opportunities, being sure these opportunities are equally accessible to traditionally marginalised groups grows ever more important.

“Trans*Code participants can come from any background, working together to create prototypes around the themes of transgender issues and access to technology.

“If you have an idea, can code, can design, want to learn, or want to improve the situation of the trans and non-binary communities through technology, please join us.”
