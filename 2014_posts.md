## Announcing Trans*Code


<strong>And so it begins…</strong>
We are starting to plan a trans* themed hack day. At present we are looking at a date in March, 2015, and we are trying to gauge interest and decide our direction.

<strong>Calling all Trans, Genderqueer, and Nonbinary Folk and Allies in the UK</strong>

We are planning an event for a Friday evening to do any needed installs, to socialize, and perhaps to hear brief talks about being trans\* in tech from a speaker or two. Then on the Saturday, we’d have a brief workshop on how to participate in a hack day (from coding and version control to etiquette), followed by a day of hacking, topped by brief presentations from all the projects to a panel of experts. We intend to have some prizes, but the purpose of the day will be more building community and skills than competition.&nbsp;

While allies will be heartily welcomed, this will be a trans-positive and safe space.&nbsp;

We’re interested in getting an idea of how many trans*, genderqueer, nonbinary, or allies would be interested in participating in something like this, and any feelings there might be about holding it in London or in Brighton. &nbsp;

So we would welcome your input – feel free to email Naomi at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171218180618/https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=info@trans-code.org" target="_blank">info@trans-code.org</a>&nbsp;with any questions or suggestions.
