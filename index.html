<p>Co-organiser Naomi Ceder explains: “As technology offers growing opportunities, being sure these opportunities are equally accessible to traditionally marginalised groups grows ever more important.</p>
<p>“Trans*Code participants can come from any background, working together to create prototypes around the themes of transgender issues and access to technology.</p>
<p>“If you have an idea, can code, can design, want to learn, or want to improve the situation of the trans and non-binary communities through technology, please join us.”</p>
